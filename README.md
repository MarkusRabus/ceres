# About the code
The principal goal of the CERES routines is the developement of fully automated pipelines for the reduction, extraction and analysis of echelle data. CERES currently counts with dedicated pipelines for eleven different instruments, which are included in the repository: APO3.5m/ARCES, CAHA2.2m/CAFE, Euler1.2m/Coralie, DuPont2.5m/Echelle, MPG2.2m/FEROS, ESO1.0m/FIDEOS, ESO3.6m/HARPS, KECK10m/HIRES, MAGELLAN6.5m/MIKE, MALLEGAN6.5m/PFS, PUC0.5m/PUCHEROS.
