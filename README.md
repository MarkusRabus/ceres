# ceres
A set of routines for processing data of echelle spectrographs

Author: Rafael Brahm (rbrahm@astro.puc.cl)

# About the code
The principal goal of the CERES routines is the developement of fully automated pipelines for the reduction, extraction and analysis of echelle data. CERES currently counts with dedicated pipelines for eleven different instruments, which are included in the repository: APO3.5m/ARCES, CAHA2.2m/CAFE, Euler1.2m/Coralie, DuPont2.5m/Echelle, MPG2.2m/FEROS, ESO1.0m/FIDEOS, ESO3.6m/HARPS, KECK10m/HIRES, MAGELLAN6.5m/MIKE, MALLEGAN6.5m/PFS, PUC0.5m/PUCHEROS. These processing recipes can be used as reference for developing pipelines for new instruments. A detailed decription of the structure and performance of these pipelines can be found in [Brahm et al 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160705792B). The standard output of the pipelines is a cube fits with the optimally extracted, wavelength calibrated and instrumetal drift corrected spectrum for each of the science images. Additionally, CERES includes routines for the computation of precise radial velocities and bisector spans via the cross-correlation method, and an automated algorithm to obtain a relatively precise guess of the atmospheric parameters of the observed star.

# Usage
In order to run one of the pipelines, you have to be in the CERES directory where the pipeline lives and run the correspondig python pipe code followed by the path to the raw data. For example in the case of the FEROS pipeline you have to enter:

    $ cd ceres/feros
    $ python ferospipe.py /path/to/the/raw/data/to/be/processed

Additionally you can add some options to the command in order to modify some of the processing steps. The allowed options are:

    -avoid_plot     if activated, the code will not generate the pdf file with the plot of the computed CCF.
    -dirout         path to the directory where the reductions will be placed. The default path will be a
                    new directory with the same name that the input directory but followed by a '_red' suffix.
    -do_class       this option will allow the code to perform the estimation of the atmospheric parameters.
    -just_extract   if activated, the code will not compute the CCF and atmospheric parameters.
    -npools         number of CPU cores to be used by the code.
    -o2do           if you want to process just one particular science object you have to enter this option
                    followed by the name of the object.
    -reffile        name of the auxiliary file that is described below. The default is './reffile.txt'
    -ofind          only in the case of slit spectrographs. Name of the image that will be used to identify
                    and trace the echelle orders.
    
For example, if you want your output directory to bee foo/, and you don't want to generate the CCF plots, and you want to perform the spectral classification, and you want to use 10 CPU cores, and you want to process only the data of the target called HATS-17, then you have to enter:

    $ python ferospipe.py /path/to/the/raw/data/to/be/processed -dirout foo/ -avoid_plot -do_class -npools 10 -o2do HATS-17
    
The auxiliary file mentioned above (reffile) corresponds to a plain text file that can be used to give specifications for particular targets that can improve the precision in the radial velocity computation. The file should contain 8 comma-sparated colummns. The colummns should contain the following information:

    1-  name of the target as specified in the image header.
    2-  right ascension of the target (J2000) with format hh:mm:ss.
    3-  declination of the target (J2000) with format dd:mm:ss.
    4-  proper motion in RA [mas/yr].
    5-  proper motion in DEC [mas/yr].
    6-  integer (0 or 1). If 0, the code uses the cordinates given in the image header.
        If 1, the code uses the coordinates given in this file.
    7-  mask that will be used to compute the CCF. Allowed entries are G2, K5 and M2.
    8-  velocity width in km/s that is used to broaden the lines of the binary mask.
        I should be similar to the standard deviation of the gaussian that is fitted to the CCF.
